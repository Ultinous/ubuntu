emscripten (1.22.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * emscripten has changed its generation backend to a LLVM target called
    fastcomp. Because we don't want to maintain a fork of LLVM in emscripten
    package, we force the usage of the previous method.
    This is done in the first line of the emcc script.
    We will either wait for fastcomp to be merged in LLVM or maybe apply the
    change in llvm Debian package.
