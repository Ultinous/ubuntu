librdkafka (0.11.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  librdkafka 0.11.0 introduced a number of default configuration changes
  that might affect its usage:

  o api.version.request
    The api.version.request property default value has changed from false to
    true, meaning that librdkafka will make use of the latest protocol
    features of the broker without the need to set the property to true
    explicitly on the client.

    WARNING: Due to a bug in Apache Kafka 0.9.0.x, the ApiVersionRequest (as
    sent by the client when connecting to the broker) will be silently ignored
    by the broker causing the request to time out after 10 seconds. This
    causes client-broker connections to stall for 10 seconds during
    connection-setup before librdkafka falls back on the
    broker.version.fallback protocol features. The workaround is to explicitly
    configure api.version.request to false on clients communicating with
    <0.9.0.x brokers.

  o Producer
    The default value of queue.buffering.max.ms was changed from 1000ms to 0ms
    (no delay). This property denotes the internal buffering time (and latency)
    for messages produced.
