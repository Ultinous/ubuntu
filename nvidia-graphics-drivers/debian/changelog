nvidia-graphics-drivers-396 (396.45-1) bionic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream short lived branch release 396.45 (2018-07-19).
    - Improved recovery of Vulkan direct-to-display applications after an
      application hang or crash.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause multi-threaded EGL applications to crash
      when exiting.
    - Added support for the following GPU: TITAN V JHH Special Edition.
  * New upstream short lived branch release 396.24 (2018-05-02).
    - Fixed a regression that caused the current MetaMode's ViewPortIn and
      ViewPortOut settings to be preserved across RandR modesets. The driver now
      clears ViewPortIn and ViewPortOut when the mode is set through RandR,
      restoring the behavior that existed prior to the regression.
    - Improved error reporting in the Vulkan driver if
      libnvidia-glvkspirv.so, the new Vulkan SPIR-V compiler added in
      396.18, cannot be found at run time.
    - Fixed performance regressions and corruption issues in the new Vulkan
      SPIR-V compiler.
    - Added support for 32-bit PCI domains throughout the NVIDIA driver stack.
      This support is required for running Linux VMs with recent versions of
      the pci_hyperv driver on top of Hyper-V.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-390 (390.67-0ubuntu1) cosmic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug that could cause kernel panics when using Quadro
      SDI Capture hardware.
    - Fixed a bug that caused kwin OpenGL compositing to crash when
      launching certain OpenGL applications.
    - Fixed an intermittent crash when launching Vulkan applications.
    - Fixed an intermittent crash when launching applications through
      Wine.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the driver, in some low bandwidth
      DisplayPort configurations, to not implicitly enable display
      dithering.  This resulted in visible banding.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-390 (390.59-0ubuntu1) cosmic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
        GeForce GTX 1050 with Max-Q Design
        Quadro P3200
        Quadro P4200
    - Added support for X.Org xserver ABI 24 (xorg-server 1.20).
    - Improved nvidia-bug-report.sh to check for kern.log which is
      the default kernel log-file location for many Debian-based
      Linux distributions.
    - Fixed a bug which could cause X servers that export a Video
      Driver ABI earlier than 0.8 to crash when running X11
      applications which call XRenderAddTraps().

    debian/templates/nvidia-kernel-common-flavour.postrm.in:
    - Fix kernel detection. We were passing an entire list of kernels
      but we really needed only the current kernel.
    - Split the scripts, udev rules, and blacklist file into the
      nvidia-kernel-common package. The nvidia-dkms package only
      includes DKMS related files now.
    - Rename nvidia-compute and nvidia-compute-no-dkms to
      nvidia-headless and nvidia-headless-no-dkms.
    - Drop the i386 dependencies from the main libraries on amd64, and
      add them to the main metapackage instead.
    - Recommend nvidia-prime (>=0.8).

  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * debian/templates/10-nvidia.conf.in,
    debian/templates/xserver-xorg-video-nvidia-flavour.install.in:
    - Rename xorg.conf.d file.
    - Drop the PrimaryGpu option from the xorg.conf.d file, as it
      has a bad interaction with systems with multiple NVIDIA GPUs
      (LP: #1756226).

  [ Graham Inggs ]
  * debian/templates/control.in:
    - Make sure that libnvidia-compute does not conflict with or
      replace opencl-icd, so that other OpenCL ICDs can be installed
      at the same time.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-390 (390.48-0ubuntu1) bionic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Updated the driver to prevent G-SYNC from being enabled when a
      Quadro Sync board is installed. G-SYNC and Quadro Sync were
      always mutually incompatible features, and this change makes it
      easier to use G-SYNC capable monitors on Quadro Sync
      configurations, as it is now no longer necessary to manually
      disable G-SYNC.
    - Further improved the fix for occasional flicker when using the
      X driver's composition pipeline.  This was mostly fixed in
      390.42, but now the fix should be more complete.
    - Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.
    - Fixed a string concatenation bug that caused libGL to
      accidentally try to create the directory "$HOME.nv" rather than
      "$HOME/.nv" in some cases where /tmp isn't accessible.
    - Increased the version numbers of the GLVND libGL, libGLESv1_CM,
      libGLESv2, and libEGL libraries, to prevent concurrently
      installed non-GLVND libraries from taking precedence in the
      dynamic linker cache.
    - Fixed a bug which could cause X servers that export a Video
      Driver ABI earlier than 0.8 to crash when running X11
      applications which call XRenderAddTraps().
  * debian/templates/dkms_nvidia.conf.in:
    - Drop buildfix_kernel_4.15.patch.
  * debian/templates/nvidia-dkms-flavour.postinst.in:
    - Add missing KERNELS variable. This fixes the following error:
      "dpkg: error: version '-' has bad syntax: revision number is empty".

nvidia-graphics-drivers-390 (390.42-0ubuntu1) bionic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a regression, introduced in 390.12, that caused occasional
      flicker when using the X driver's composition pipeline, for
      example when using screen transformations like rotation, or the
      "ForceCompositionPipeline" or "ForceFullCompositionPipeline"
      options."

    - Make sure to enable both systemd services, and let dh_systemd
      do all the work.
    - Install nvidia-fallback.service. This loads nouveau if nvidia
      fails to load.
    - Remove any references to ld.so.conf.
